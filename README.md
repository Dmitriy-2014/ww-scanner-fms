# Scanner FMS or ww-scanner-fms
 Scanner FMS â€“ A simple plugin scanner for your main theme in WordPress. Looks for suspicious inclusions in theme files. ( base64, eval, shell_exec, etc. )

# Attention
 This scanner is very simple and can find a lot of false matches, so do not delete the found code in any case, as it may be normal running code in your theme, remember    that this plugin only looks for suspicious occurrences.
 
 Decisions to remove code need to be made carefully and wisely.
